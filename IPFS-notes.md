## Browsers

1. Brave


## Filecoin

1. The Filecoin network is a great building block for any decentralized storage system.
1. Filecoin's proving algorithms:
  - Proof of Replication: proves that a given storage provider is storing a unique copy of a client's original data.
  - Proof of Spacetime: proves that the client's data is stored continuously over time.


## NFT.Storage

### Upload images, assets and metadata

1. Expects the metadata to conform to the ERC-1155 metadata schema.
```
const nft = {
    image, // use image Blob as `image` field
    name: "Storing the World's Most Valuable Virtual Assets with NFT.Storage",
    description: "The metaverse is here. Where is it all being stored?",
    properties: {
      type: "blog-post",
      origins: {
        http: "https://blog.nft.storage/posts/2021-11-30-hello-world-nft-storage/",
        ipfs: "ipfs://bafybeieh4gpvatp32iqaacs6xqxqitla4drrkyyzq6dshqqsilkk3fqmti/blog/post/2021-11-30-hello-world-nft-storage/"
      },

      content: {
        "text/markdown": "The last year has witnessed the explosion of NFTs onto the worldâ€™s mainstage.

      }
    }
  }
```
1. Use ```const metadata = await client.store(nft)```.

### Content Archive (CAR)
1. The type of data stored in CARs is defined by IPLD.
1. Create and interact with CAR files (Command line)
  - ipfs-car
    1. install: ```npm install -g ipfs-car```
    1. create a new CAR file: ```ipfs-car --pack path/to/files --output path/to/write/a.car```
    1. extract files from CAR: ```ipfs-car --unpack path/to/my.car --output /path/to/unpack/files/to```
    1. list the contents of a CAR: ```ipfs-car --list path/to/my.car```
1. Work with CAR files in applications:
  - ipfs-car: includes library functions for packing and unpacking files into CARs, using the IPFS UnixFs data model.
  - go-car: provides the main Golang implementation of the CAR specification.

### Gateways

1. To make IPFS data accessible outside of the peer-to-peer network, special IPFS nodes called "gateways" act as bridges between the HTTP protocol that all web browsers understand and the peer-to-peer Bitswap protocol.

### Javascript client library
